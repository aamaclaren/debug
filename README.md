# Debug

## Description
A game where the player is a programmer and is tasked with making sure the program on screen runs as expected. Bugs will attack the code and attempt to alter it as the program is running. The programmer must fix the errors in the code that the bugs create or prevent them from making errors by squashing them before they reach the code.
